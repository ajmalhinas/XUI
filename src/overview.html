  The Purnama Project XUI (XML-based User Interface) API is an set of program
  calls that utilize the XUI tagset and perform the task of creating a user
  interface. The Purnama Project XUI API is specific using Java as the platform
  but other XUI APIs may use other libraries and platforms. The Purnama XUI API
  supports the creation of Swing components, adding, deleting and laying out
  components. It also supports dynamic binding of business logic to the user
  interface.

<p> The Purnama Project XUI (XML-based User Interface) API is an set of program 
  calls that utilize the XUI tagset and perform the task of creating a user interface. 
  The Purnama version of this API is specific using Java as the platform but other 
  XUI APIs may use other libraries and platforms. The Purnama XUI API supports 
  the creation of Swing components, adding, deleting and laying out components. 
  It also supports dynamic binding of business logic to the user interface.</p>
<p>The API is of course written in Java utilizing Java's Swing UI API and although 
  it ties this particular API to the Java platform and to Swing, it does not however 
  tie the XUI technology to the Swing API or even to Java. XML is a cross platform, 
  cross language technology. Other API implementations may be created using this 
  XML format allowing for user interfaces to be built simply by creating XML documents.</p>
<p>The current limitation with the XUI technology is that the bindings are currently 
  tied to the platform that the GUI is being run on. This implies that a business 
  logic library is written for the platform that the XUI document is written for. 
  In the future this may (and hopefully) will change.</p>
<p>The Purnama Project XUI API is an attempt at addressing the needs of the Semantic 
  Web. To date, there is not much addressing what to do with resources once they 
  are found. Semantic Web resources can of course be anything under the sun and 
  so to assume that a textual representation of that resource is the only answer 
  would be far too limiting for such a new and imaginative technology. The Purnama 
  Project XUI API attempts to address this requirement.</p>
<p>The XUI API requires the use of the XUI XML Schema which is based on the W3C 
  XML Recommendation as well as the W3C Schema Recommendation.For more information 
  about the XUI XML Specification, see <a href="http://geekkit.bcit.ca/xui/">The 
  Purnama Project home page</a>. The XUI API also comes with a guide which is 
  a tutorial and addresses the examples that are part of the download. For more 
  information about the XUI API guide, visit <a href="http://geekkit.bcit.ca/xui/">The 
  Purnama Project home page</a>.</p>
