<p>This package offers a collection of what are called '<i>composite</i>' components. 
  Composite components behave like atomic components but are made up of several 
  components together. For example, if you look at the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">XUICalendar</font> 
  class, it actually consists of a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">XUITable</font> 
  and two <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">XUIButton</font>s. This gives 
  a greater feature set and does not require the end programmer to come up with 
  these types of components. However, the composite component functions just like 
  an atomic component.</p>
<p>For more information about the XUI API, look at the XUI API guide which is 
  part of this download or if you didn't download it, visit <a href="http://geekkit.bcit.ca/xui/">The 
  Purnama Project home page</a>. This guide will give you a much deeper understanding 
  as to what can be done with this API. As well, be sure to look at the examples 
  that accompany this API download as well.
