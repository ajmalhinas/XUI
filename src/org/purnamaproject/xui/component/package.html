<p>This package only consists of one interface: <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">XUIComponent</font>, 
  which is the top abstract class from which all other components inherit from. 
  That is to say, it is at the top of the inheritance hierarchy. The core functionality 
  provides programmers the ability to set coordinates and get a component based 
  on its ID value (from the XML). This becomes important when referring to a hierarchy 
  of components where there are many.</p>
<p>Based on the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">XUIComponent</font> there 
  are several other sub types available:
<ul>
  <li>Top-level containers</li>
  <li>Intermediate containers</li>
  <li>Atomic</li>
  <li>Composite</li>
  <li>Menu</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these categories contains one or several different components that 
  add functionality in creating a graphical user interface.
<p>For more information about the XUI API, look at the XUI API guide which is 
  part of this download or if you didn't download it, visit <a href="http://geekkit.bcit.ca/xui/">The 
  Purnama Project home page</a>. This guide will give you a much deeper understanding 
  as to what can be done with this API. As well, be sure to look at the examples 
  that accompany this API download as well.
