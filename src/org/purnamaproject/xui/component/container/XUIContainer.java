 * The Purnama Project XUI (XML-based User Interface) API is an set of program
 * calls that utilize the XUI tagset and perform the task of creating a user
 * interface. The Purnama version of this API is specific using Java as the platform
 * but other XUI APIs may use other libraries and platforms. The Purnama XUI API
 * supports the creation of Swing components, adding, deleting and laying out
 * components. It also supports dynamic binding of business logic to the user
 * interface.
