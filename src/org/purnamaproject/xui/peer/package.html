<p>This package consists of '<i>native</i>' or '<i>peer</i>' components. Peer 
  or native meaning that the platform that Purnam Project XUI is sitting on (Java) 
  with the specific GUI implemented (Swing). From a Java perspective, to say that 
  Java or Swing is native or is a peer sounds odd. However, within the perspective 
  of XUI which expects cross platform <i>and</i> cross language, it makes sense.</p>
<p>XUI should be something that is read in by any platform in any language. Don't 
  forget, Java is a language but it is also a platform. You can run your Java 
  programs so long as you have the Java platform running on your computer. XUI 
  could very well (and hopefully will be) implemented on other platforms. One 
  such platform would be the C# platform. Another could be KDE within Linux. And 
  yet another example could be SWT within Java. As you can see, there are many 
  different examples. If this being the case, then a GUI could be loaded from 
  any platform in any language on any computer.</p>
<p>These classes are not directly something that users of the XUI API need to 
  concern themselves with. The bulk of the classes within this package are considered 
  helper classes to the underlying peers (peers as described above).</p>
<p>For more information about the XUI API, look at the XUI API guide which is 
  part of this download or if you didn't download it, visit <a href="http://geekkit.bcit.ca/xui/">The 
  Purnama Project home page</a>. This guide will give you a much deeper understanding 
  as to what can be done with this API. As well, be sure to look at the examples 
  that accompany this API download as well.
