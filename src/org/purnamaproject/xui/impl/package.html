<p>This package consists of classes that implement the abstract types found within 
  the API. Implenenting classes may tie themselves to other APIs and other abstract 
  classes or conrete classes. However, this is not important as only the abstract 
  types are ever referred to within the interface of this API. Users do not normally 
  need to use or look at the classes found in this package. Implementors of XUI 
  in other languages or other GUI APIs may wish to see these as starting places 
  for creating implementations of the interfaces.</p>
<p>For more information about the XUI API, look at the XUI API guide which is 
  part of this download or if you didn't download it, visit <a href="http://geekkit.bcit.ca/xui/">The 
  Purnama Project home page</a>. This guide will give you a much deeper understanding 
  as to what can be done with this API. As well, be sure to look at the examples 
  that accompany this API download as well.
