Provides classes and interfaces for handling the core set of functionality when 
dealing with a XUI document. This package provides immediate functionality for 
the user to read in a XUI document and begin creating user interfaces with XML 
documents. 
<h2> Reading in a document</h2>
<p>Actually, within the XML community the proper term is '<i>unmarshalling</i>' 
  especially when it means that the XML document will be turned into something 
  other than XML. Of course in the Object Oriented world of programming in the 
  very least this will turn the document into a DOM (document object model). In 
  the world of XUI however, this means going further than that. In XUI the XML 
  is unmarshalled and then turned into a graphical user interface (GUI). Let's 
  look at an example. In order to read in a XUI document we use the following 
  Java code: 
<pre>try<br>{<br>   // from a file, parse, build, serialize.<br>   XUIBuilder builder = XUIBuilderFactory.getInstance().getXUIBuilder();  // <b>(1)</b>
<br>   builder.parse(&quot;mygui.xml&quot;); // <b>(2)</b>
<br>   XUI xui = builder.getXUIDocument();  // <b>(3)</b>
<br>   // display it<br>   xui.visualize();  // <b>(4)</b>
<br>} catch (IOException ioe)
{
   ioe.printStackTrace();

} catch (XUIParseException xpe)
{
   xpe.printStackTrace();

}</pre>
<p>Based on the above code, this will (1) get ahold of a <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">XUIBuilder</font> 
  using the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">XUIBuilderFactory</font>. 
  The factory is important in hiding the details of the builder since the builder's 
  inheritance and helper classes are not important. The fact that it returns something 
  meaninful is important. The next step winds up being to call the builder's parse 
  method. This requires handing the builder's parse method a file name. The next 
  step is to ask the builder to return the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">XUI 
  </font>document. The XUI document is an unmarshalled version of the xml document. 
  It contains all of the user interface code that has been built and represented 
  based on what was found inside of the XML document. Lastly we request the XUI 
  document to 'visualize' itself. This is the last and final step in displaying 
  a graphical version of the XUI document. The last part of the document is simple 
  exception handling and is required. 
<p>As the above example shows, it is not overly complex for creating a GUI based 
  from the XUI API.
<p>&nbsp;
<h2>Going One Step Further </h2>
<p>The above example is nice. It shows how to bring up a user interface. If you've 
  already tried the above code in one of your own Java classes, you've quickly 
  realized a major limitation. There is no event handling. The following code 
  shows the extra line of code to do the binding:
<pre>

try<br>{<br>   // from a file, parse, build, serialize.<br>   XUIBuilder builder = XUIBuilderFactory.getInstance().getXUIBuilder();  // <b>(1)</b>
<br>   builder.parse(&quot;mygui.xml&quot;); // <b>(2)</b>
<br>   XUI xui = builder.getXUIDocument();  // <b>(3)</b>
<br>   // display it<br>   xui.visualize();  // <b>(4)</b>

   // bind it<br>   <b>xui.bind();</b>  // <b>(5)</b>

<br>} catch (IOException ioe)
{
   ioe.printStackTrace();

} catch (XUIParseException xpe)
{
   xpe.printStackTrace();

} catch (XUIBindingException xbe)
{
   xbe.printStackTrace();
}
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;
<h2>Back Out As XML</h2>
<p>Binding will bind any outside libraries to the GUI. There is one more exception 
  that has to be caught. Of course this all implies that libaries have already 
  been built and are sitting at some URL (local or remote) and are bundled in 
  a Java archive and waiting to be used. One last example shows how to send out 
  the document back as XML. As above we called bringing in the XML document unmarshalling. 
  So what do we call it when we save the XML document back out? You guessed it, 
  '<i>marshalling</i>'. 
<pre>try<br>{<br>   // from a file, parse, build, serialize.<br>   XUIBuilder builder = XUIBuilderFactory.getInstance().getXUIBuilder();  // <b>(1)</b>
<br>   builder.parse(&quot;mygui.xml&quot;); // <b>(2)</b>
<br>   XUI xui = builder.getXUIDocument();  // <b>(3)</b>
<br>   // display it<br>   xui.visualize();  // <b>(4)</b>

   // bind it<br>   xui.bind();  // <b>(5)</b>

   // get root to save out to file<br>   <b>XUINode root = xui.getRoot();</b> // <b>(6)</b>
<br>   // finally save out to file system<br>   <b>xui.marshalXUI(&quot;parsed_mygui.xml&quot;);</b> // <b>(7)</b>

<br>} catch (IOException ioe)
{
   ioe.printStackTrace();

} catch (XUIParseException xpe)
{
   xpe.printStackTrace();

} catch (XUIBindingException xbe)
{
   xbe.printStackTrace();
}</pre>
<p>There you are. You are now capable of visualizing a GUI without writing any 
  GUI code! Hopefully this gives you an overview of what you can do. For more 
  information about the XUI API, look at the XUI API guide which is part of this 
  download or if you didn't download it, visit <a href="http://geekkit.bcit.ca/xui/">The 
  Purnama Project home page</a>. This guide will give you a much deeper understanding 
  as to what can be done with this API. As well, be sure to look at the examples 
  that accompany this API download as well.
