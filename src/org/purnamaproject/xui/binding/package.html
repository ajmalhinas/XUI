<p>This package offers the feature of being able to dynamically (at runtime) link 
  to business logic that may be downloaded either from a local filesystem or a 
  remote server. The interfaces found within this API need to be implemented on 
  the model side (i.e. business logic). This allows for a clean separation of 
  the model side which represents the business logic from the graphical user interface 
  code. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Seeing It Work</h2>
<p>Allowing for code to be dynamically loaded and bound is a powerful feature. 
  It is the prominant feature in the current Web allowing Web browsers to load 
  plug-ins of all sorts. But what if we take it one step further and say that 
  our program is not bound to a user interface? What if the program we load is 
  like a blank slate? A canvas without paint? This would allow us to completely 
  fill in the user interface during runtime and load completely different program 
  code each time. This is what the XUI API and the supporting binding feature 
  within it do. Let's first look at a simple example of a XUI document representing 
  a very simple user interface:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;!-- Generated by The Purnama Project XUI API version 0.5 --&gt;<br>&lt;xui:XUI xmlns:xui=&quot;http://xml.bcit.ca/PurnamaProject/2003/xui&quot;
     xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
     xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://xml.bcit.ca/PurnamaProject/2003/xui ../../xui.xsd&quot;
     id=&quot;http://xml.bcit.ca/PurnamaProject/examples/Calendar&quot;&gt;
<br>  &lt;xui:Window id=&quot;window_0&quot; name=&quot;XUI Calendar&quot; x=&quot;200&quot; y=&quot;20&quot; width=&quot;280&quot; height=&quot;220&quot; visible=&quot;true&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;xui:GridLayout width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/xui:GridLayout&gt;<br>    &lt;xui:Panel x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; id=&quot;panel_0&quot; name=&quot;panel&quot; idref=&quot;window_0&quot;&gt;<br>      &lt;xui:GridLayout width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/xui:GridLayout&gt;<br>      &lt;xui:Calendar x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; id=&quot;calendar_0&quot;&gt;&lt;/xui:Calendar&gt;<br>    &lt;/xui:Panel&gt;<br>  &lt;/xui:Window&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;!-- The library (model) code that drives the user interface --&gt;
   <b>&lt;xui:Resource type=&quot;java&quot; class=&quot;CalendarModel&quot; 
        uri=&quot;http://xml.bcit.ca/xml/PurnamaProject/xui/Calendar.jar&quot;&gt;&lt;/xui:Resource&gt;</b>
&lt;/xui:XUI&gt;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>The above example shows the actual XUI document describing a user interface. 
  The user interface will not respond to event handling unless of course we bind 
  code to it. In order to do this we use the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">xui:Resource</font> 
  element (shown above in bold). The URI shows <i>where</i> to download the resource. 
  We can point the URI anywhere we wish to so long as we give it an absolute path. 
  The Java JAR file called Calendar.jar contains the code required to handle the 
  closing of a window. The class handling it is <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CalendarModel</font> 
  as contained in the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">class</font> attribute. 
  The only assumption made about the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CalendarModel</font> 
  class is that it has a method called init with the following method signature:
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">public void init(XUI xui)</font>
<p>That's it. In fact, the class <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CalendarModel</font> 
  could be called <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">foo</font>. That is 
  your choice. It only needs to be spelled the same way it is spelled in the class 
  attribute above. The implementation of the init method is up to you. If you 
  wish to make it bind the logic to the GUI you may. If you wish for the init 
  method to call up other classes, that will work as well. The following is a 
  simple binding example for handling the closing of the window:
<pre>public class CalendarModel implements <b>WindowModel</b><br>{<br>  private XUI xui;</pre>
<pre>  private XUIWindow calendarWindow;</pre>
<pre>  <b>public void init(XUI document)</b>
  {
     // local reference of the XUI document
     xui = document;</pre>
<pre>     calendarWindow = (XUIWindow)xui.getXUIComponent(&quot;window_0&quot;);</pre>
<pre>     calendarWindow.addEventListener(this);
   }</pre>
<pre>  <b>public void windowAction(XUIComponent component)</b>
  {
     if(component == calendarWindow)
     {
        System.exit(0);
      }
  }</pre>
<pre>}

</pre>
<p>Notice the above code has the init method? It's purpose in this simple example 
  is to allow the model to bind itself to the GUI code that has been generated 
  by XUI. XUI created the GUI and is allowing the programmer to bind model (business 
  logic) to the GUI without actually seeing the inner workings. The <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">windowAction</font> 
  method is the sole method for the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">WindowModel</font> 
  interface which handles the event of a window closing. That's all. Of course 
  you can insert other code in there to check if a file has been saved, whether 
  or not network connections have been successfully closed, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Limitation</h2>
<p>With this present version, the binding calls do not do any security checking. 
  There is no use of SSL (secured socket layer), certificates, public keys, limiting 
  access to the local file system or checking of CPU usage. For this reason it 
  is recommended that only trusted business logic be used. See the license for 
  full details on this disclaimer.

<p>For more information about the XUI API, look at the XUI API guide which is 
  part of this download or if you didn't download it, visit <a href="http://geekkit.bcit.ca/xui/">The 
  Purnama Project home page</a>. This guide will give you a much deeper understanding 
  as to what can be done with this API. As well, be sure to look at the examples 
  that accompany this API download as well.
